Last week I made a website -- **[Listen ABC](http://abc.lazywei.com)**.

It is a website to listen "60 sec science" online, and moreover it allow you set an interval and repeat it i.e. you can do AB Repeat on it!

If you find any bugs please contact me.

And here is the source codeâ€™s repo on [github](https://github.com/lazywei/abc)
